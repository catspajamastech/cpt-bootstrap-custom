# cpt-bootstrap-custom
A very minimal bootstrap plugin for Wordpress that links to the bootstrap CDN. Forget that silly business of editing functions.php. 

## Instructions
In a typical Wordpress configuration, simply download these files into /wp-content/plugins/cpt-bootstrap-custom (creating the latter directory).

Afterwards, be sure to Activate the plugin via Wordpress' admin Plugin screen.

You should then be enabled to hand-code using all the basic bootstrap CSS framework components.

(If the plugin doesn't populate in the Plugin admin screen after copy files & refreshing the Plugins screen, you may have copied the files to an incorrect location, or have the directory named incorrectly, etc.)
